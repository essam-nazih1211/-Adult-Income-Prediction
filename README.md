Project Description
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on census data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes various demographic features such as age, workclass, education, occupation, gender, and more. This project involves preprocessing the data, feature engineering, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Adult" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 48,842 instances and 14 attributes. The target variable is income, which is a binary variable indicating whether an individual's income is greater than $50K.

Files
adult.csv: The dataset file containing the census data.
notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Dependencies
Python 3.6+
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adult-income-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd adult-income-prediction
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:

Loading the dataset.
Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
Dropping redundant features.
Converting binary categorical variables to numerical format.
Feature Engineering
One-hot encoding was applied to categorical variables such as occupation, workclass, marital-status, race, relationship, and native-country.
The education feature was dropped since it was represented by education-num.
The gender and income features were converted to numerical format.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Correlation matrices were plotted to visualize the relationships between features. Features with low correlation to the target variable were dropped to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

Model Training
A Random Forest classifier was used for training the model. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model was trained and evaluated using the training data.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using the accuracy score. The trained Random Forest model was tested on the test set to determine its performance.

Usage
To run the project, execute the Jupyter Notebook notebook.ipynb. The notebook includes all steps from data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Results
The results of the model evaluation, including the accuracy score and the feature importances, are included in the Jupyter Notebook.
